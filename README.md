# JS-Project-5---Use-a-public-API-to-create-an-employee-directory

TREEHOUSE TECHDEGREE FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT - PROJECT 5 - USE A PUBLIC API TO CREATE AN EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY

What the program does:

It uses the Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random “employees", and builds a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
A JSON object is requested from the API and the data is parsed so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address. The 'previous' and 'next' buttons provide navigation through the employees list. A search field can be used to filter for a specific name, email, username or location.
